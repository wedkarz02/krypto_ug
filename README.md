Cryptography assignments for the University lecture.

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is for educational purposes only and should not be used in anything by anyone ever (other than messing around and learning stuff). Anything and everything here might or might not be working at any point in time. I take absolutely zero responsibility if you somehow break something, cause havoc, or the code simply doesn’t work. If you’re here expecting stability or sanity, you’re in the wrong place. If you still want to proceed - have fun!

## Requirements

 - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
 - [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 - Enough common sense to not actually use any of this for anything

Additionally there are some bash script so you might need a Linux OS for that.

## Download

Download the source code using the ```git clone``` command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wedkarz02/krypto_ug.git
```

Or use the *Download ZIP* option from the Github repository [page](https://github.com/wedkarz02/krypto_ug.git).

## Quick Start

To compile everything in the workspace simply run:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

or to compile individual crates:

```bash
$ cargo build -p [crate-name]
```

Executable files will be created in ```target/debug``` directory.
